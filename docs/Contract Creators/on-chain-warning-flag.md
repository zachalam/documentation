# Background
---

Data feed consumers need strong monitoring around the Chainlink reference contracts theyâ€™re using. The goal of this feature is to provide the ability for smart contracts to check the state of a reference contract and depending on the result, the user could decide to disable (even automatically) functionality such as exchange or liquidations at the smart contract level for their respective DApp. 

A smart contract has been deployed containing a mapping of every data feed mapped to a state. The state will be a boolean marking whether a reference contract address is in a warning state depending on the behavior of the data feed. This state will initially be set by the Chainlink team which benefits from a strong monitoring capability and 24/7 coverage. Later on, itâ€™s intended to decentralize this process in order to allow for automation as well as governance to take over the setting of the flag.

# Implementation
---

Using the warning flag is pretty straight forward in your contract. Simply set a reference to the Flags contract. Then check if a flag is raised for the desired feed.


## Constructor

A reference to the warning flag contract needs to be set.

```javascript Solidity v0.6
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/Flags.sol"

contract FeedConsumer {
  Flags internal warningFlags;
  constructor(<other arguments>, address _warningFlags)
    warningFlags = Flags(_warningFlags);
}
```


## Check flag

In order to check the flag on a specific feed, call the `.getFlag(address)` method on the Flags contract.

The function takes one parameter:
  - `address` - The contract address for the feed you want to check

The function below checks that the flag for the feed at `0xF79D6aFBb6dA890132F9D7c355e3015f15F3406F` has not been raised, before it continues execution of the critical section.

```javascript Solidity v0.6
function doSomethingCritical() public returns (bool) {
  // check that flag is not raised
  require(!warningFlags.getFlag("0xF79D6aFBb6dA890132F9D7c355e3015f15F3406F"));

  // add your critical logic here that uses the
  // feed at 0xF79D6aFBb6dA890132F9D7c355e3015f15F3406F
  return true;
}
```
