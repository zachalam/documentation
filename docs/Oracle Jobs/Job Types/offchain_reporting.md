OCR jobs are currently used very similarly to Flux Monitor jobs: they update data feeds with aggregated data from many Chainlink oracle nodes. However, they do this aggregation using a cryptographically-secure off-chain protocol that makes it possible for only a single node to submit all answers from all participating nodes during each round (with proofs that the other nodes' answers were legitimately provided by those nodes), which saves a significant amount of gas.

#### Bootstrap node

Every OCR cluster requires at least one bootstrap node as a kind of "rallying point" that enables the other nodes to find one another. Bootstrap nodes do not participate in the aggregation protocol and do not submit answers to the feed.

**Spec format**

```jpv2
type               = "offchainreporting"
schemaVersion      = 1
contractAddress    = "0x27548a32b9aD5D64c5945EaE9Da5337bc3169D15"
p2pBootstrapPeers  = [
    "/dns4/chain.link/tcp/1234/p2p/16Uiu2HAm58SP7UL8zsnpeuwHfytLocaqgnyaYKP8wu7qRdrixLju",
]
isBootstrapPeer = true
externalJobID   = "0EEC7E1D-D0D2-476C-A1A8-72DFB6633F05"
```

**Shared fields**
See [shared fields](/docs/jobs/#shared-fields).

**Unique fields**

- `contractAddress`: the address of the `OffchainReportingAggregator` contract.
- `p2pBootstrapPeers`: a list of libp2p dial addresses of the other bootstrap nodes helping oracle nodes find one another on the network.
- `isBootstrapPeer`: this must be set to `true`.

**Job type specific pipeline variables**

- `$(jobSpec.databaseID)`: the ID of the job spec in the local database. You shouldn't need this in 99% of cases.
- `$(jobSpec.externalJobID)`: the globally-unique job ID for this job. Used to coordinate between node operators in certain cases.
- `$(jobSpec.name)`: the local name of the job.
- `$(jobRun.meta)`: a map of metadata that can be sent to a bridge, etc.

#### Oracle node

Oracle nodes, on the other hand, are responsible for submitting answers.

**Shared fields**
See [shared fields](/docs/jobs/#shared-fields).

**Unique fields**

- `contractAddress`: the address of the `OffchainReportingAggregator` contract.
- `p2pPeerID`: the base58-encoded libp2p public key of this node.
- `p2pBootstrapPeers`: a list of libp2p dial addresses of the other bootstrap nodes helping oracle nodes find one another on the network.
- `keyBundleID`: the hash of the OCR key bundle to be used by this node (the Chainlink node keystore manages these key bundles â€” use the subcommands under `chainlink keys ocr` to interact with them or use the Operator UI).
- `monitoringEndpoint`: the URL of the telemetry endpoint to send OCR metrics to.
- `transmitterAddress`: the Ethereum address from which to send aggregated submissions to the OCR contract.
- `observationTimeout`: the maximum duration to wait before an off-chain request for data is considered to be failed/unfulfillable.
- `blockchainTimeout`: the maximum duration to wait before an on-chain request for data is considered to be failed/unfulfillable.
- `contractConfigTrackerSubscribeInterval`: the interval at which to retry subscribing to on-chain config changes if a subscription has not yet successfully been made.
- `contractConfigTrackerPollInterval`: the interval at which to proactively poll the on-chain config for changes.
- `contractConfigConfirmations`: the number of blocks to wait after an on-chain config change before considering it worthy of acting upon.

**Job type specific pipeline variables**
