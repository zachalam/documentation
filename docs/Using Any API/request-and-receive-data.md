# Call Any External API

> ðŸ“˜ Note

> If your smart contracts need access to price data, try using [Chainlink Data Feeds](../using-chainlink-reference-contracts/).

Chainlink enables your contracts to access to *any* external data source, through our decentralized oracle network.

Whether your contract requires sports results, the latest weather, or any other publicly available data, the <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/tree/master/contracts" target="_blank">Chainlink contract library</a> provides the tools required for your contract to consume it.

# Connect Your Smart Contracts to the Outside World

We understand that building smart contracts is difficult enough as it is, and making your contracts compatible with off-chain data just adds to the complexity. Therefore, we created a framework with minimal requirements, yet unbounded flexibility, so you can focus more on the functionality of your smart contracts rather than what feeds them.

Chainlinkâ€™s decentralized oracle network provides smart contracts with the ability to push and pull data, facilitating the interoperability between on-chain and off-chain applications.
