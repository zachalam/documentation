# Basic Request Model

Chainlink connects smart contracts with external data using its decentralized oracle network. Chainlink API requests are handled 1:1 by an oracle.

The [Basic Request Model](../architecture-request-model/) describes the on-chain architecture of requesting data from a single oracle source.

To learn how to make a GET request using a single oracle, see [Make a GET Request](../make-a-http-get-request/).

# Decentralized Data Model

For a more robust and trustworthy answer, you can aggregate data from many oracles. With on-chain aggregation, data is aggregated from a decentralized network of independent oracle nodes. This architecture is applied to Chainlink Data Feeds, which can aggregate data such as asset price data.

The [Decentralized Data Model](../architecture-decentralized-model/) describes how data is aggregated, and how consumer contracts can retrieve this data.

To learn how to consume the price of ETH in your smart contract, see [Get the Latest Price](../get-the-latest-price/).
